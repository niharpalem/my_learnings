# My Learnings

Welcome to my learning repository! Here you'll find code examples, tutorials, and notes from my learning journey.

## Repositories

Here are some of the repositories that I've created during my learning journey:

-  (https://github.com/niharpalem/hover_and_pixify/blob/1ddef5141dcd241b9a1b5bf272a62f8999eb66a7/pixel_value_identifer.ipynb) - this is where we can see the pixel values at desired locations on a given inout image.
- (https://github.com/niharpalem/face-rec/blob/4b301fc0d0d0533b2900e130891877b307023a0e/face_rec_code.py) - this is where we talk about fiducial points for face recognition.
- (https://github.com/niharpalem/is_blurry/blob/92ce757d98049933a5f41a8e2ee50b4623618680/blurrcheck.ipynb) - this is a way to check whether a given image is blurry or not 
- (https://github.com/niharpalem/key-features/blob/b3348dcac23c16612fc02b290fc272805ac2df48/key_feature.ipynb) - after training any model using this we can identify the key features inside of our trained ML model.
- (https://github.com/niharpalem/smart-eda/blob/8557396a3e3076ab14db63853605c48a6ed59ad2/smarteda.ipynb) - A new of automated EDA.

Each repository contains code files and a README file with more information about the project.

## Medium Articles

I've also written several Medium articles where I delve deeper into some topics. You can find my Medium profile here: (https://medium.com/@nihar-palem)
